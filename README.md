# Automating-Nit-patna-Captive-Portal


- I used selenium for python to automate the web page that pop up after the system connects to the wifi network of my college campus,
- I used python and some modules for web page automation and created a script that login into the network automatically.
- This is very cool, this is one click login, no need to feed password again and again.
- I then coverted the scripts to from .py to .exe file.
- this remove the steps for going into terminal and writing python and runnig the .py file.
